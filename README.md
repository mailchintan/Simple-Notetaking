# Simple Notetaking
This is the code repository for Simple Notetaking. For short I'll use SNT below :smile:

## Installation link
Here mate: [SNT](https://goo.gl/RNiFFj)

## What is
SNT is just a simple Google Chrome plugin that allows you to take quick notes directly in your browser.

It accepts only simple text without any formatting.

## How it works
SNT uses your browser local storage to save the information you write in the box.

## What is it good for
- Quick notetaking
- Store a bunch of text just because you want to
- I don't know what I can say more :sweat_smile:

## Mind if I use this code and make it better?
Not at all. Suit yourself! There's a button at the top called "Fork"
